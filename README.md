# SCARLET-X
SCARLET-X (Smart Controlled Adaptive Responsive Light for Efficient Traffic) is an Arduino-based traffic system that uses ultrasonic sensors for vehicle detection and a pedestrian button for safe crossings. It optimizes signal timing and conserves power by keeping the light red when no vehicles are detected.
